# 2026 Python Project Journey: Collaborative Development Portfolio

A year-long, collaborative portfolio of 45+ Python projects built to master software development fundamentals, modern tooling, and professional teamwork.

## 👥 About The Developers
This repository is the shared workspace of two first-year IT Engineering students using a hands-on, project-based approach to solidify our computer science foundations and engineering practices.
## 🎯 Project Goals
Our primary goals for this collaborative series are:
1.  **Build Core Proficiency:** Achieve fluency in core Python, data structures, algorithms, and systematic problem-solving through weekly application.
2.  **Master Professional Workflow:** Implement and internalize industry-standard practices using Git, collaborative GitHub workflows (feature branching, pull requests, and code reviews), and clear documentation.
3.  **Create a Comprehensive Portfolio:** Develop a tangible, growing body of work that demonstrates our technical skills, consistent growth, and ability to collaborate effectively on complex projects over time.

We follow a structured plan to build and document **one complete project per week** throughout 2026.

## 🛠️ Technology & Practices
- **Primary Language:** Python 3
- **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git with a strict GitHub Flow (Feature Branches + Pull Requests + Code Review)
- **Development Tools:** VS Code, GitHub Projects
- **Code Standards:** Conventional Commits, detailed per-project READMEs
- **Focus Areas:** CLI tools, data analysis & automation, web APIs, application development.

## 🚀 How to Explore This Repository
1.  **Browse by Timeline:** Navigate the folders by month to see our progression from foundational to more advanced concepts.
2.  **Review Our Process:** Examine the commit history and pull requests to see our collaborative workflow, how we provide feedback, and integrate code.
